# Event building

This is the last step in the (central) data preparation.
The commissioning has to be performed before.


## Prerequisites

- The DAQ's data converted into root format
- A masked channels file
- A pedestal file
- A MIP calibration file

## Usage

Either change the default values (mainly in [`help_tools.py`](./help_tools.py))
or provide the changed through the command line interface.
For an exhaustive list of steering options, see the program's help:

```python
python buildevents.py --help
```

The top-level [`Makefile`](../Makefile) demonstrates the whole data preparation chain,
starting with the raw `.dat` files from the DAQ.

## Features

- Build events from the raw data using calibration information.
- Apply a BCID merging of nearby, good BCIDs.

Merges all 9 files in one (adding one extra dimension to the arrays).
It does also the inversion between high gain and tdc if this is the case.
It also makes the bcid-offset correction between fev13s and slbs

## (Old) ToDos

1. What about the auto gain? This bit is not included in the standard RAW2ROOT output, 
  so I did not used it here.
